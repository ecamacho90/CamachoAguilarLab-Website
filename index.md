# Sy(Stem)s Developmental Biology

With a multidisciplinary mindset, our lab leverages in vitro experimental studies with stem cells, bioengineering techniques, and novel mathematical modeling approaches to study how cells interact and interpret dynamic signaling in time and space to create precise patterns during human embryonic development.
