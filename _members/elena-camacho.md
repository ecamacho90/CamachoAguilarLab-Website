Elena completed a 5-year degree in Mathematics at the University of Seville, completing two undergraduate research fellowships in the Department of Algebra under the supervision of Prof. Fco. Jesús Castro-Jiménez and Prof. Antonio Rojas. Funded by a La Caixa Foundation Scholarship and an EPSRC doctoral Scholarship, she completed an MSc and PhD in Interdisciplinary Mathematics under the supervision of Prof. David A. Rand. Her work focused on mathematically formalizing the Waddington landscape metaphor, and she leveraged this novel mathematical framework to study C. elegans vulval development and murine trunk development, the latter in collaboration with Prof. James Briscoe (UK) and Prof. Eric Siggia (USA). In March 2018, she joined Prof. Aryeh Warmflash’s lab at Rice University to gain first-hand experimental experience in stem cell research and bioengineering techniques. In November 2023, she started her lab the Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo as a María de Maeztu Junior Principal Investigator.

In her free time, she loves cooking, crafting, going to the gym, playing tennis, reading and listening to podcasts!
