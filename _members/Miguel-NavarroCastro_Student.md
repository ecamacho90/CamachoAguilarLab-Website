Miguel graduated with a Mathematics degree in 2022 and a Master’s in Mathematics in 2024 from Universidad de Sevilla. During his undergraduate and Master’s studies, he worked in the Department of Algebra under the supervision of Dr. Alberto Castaño Dominguez, where he developed a strong foundation in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. He was awarded a summer fellowship through the “Programa de Iniciación a la Investigación 2023/24” from the Mathematics Institute at Universidad de Sevilla (IMUS) to conduct research on the quantitative analysis of stem cell responses to various stimuli. Under the guidance of Dr. Elena Camacho Aguilar and Dr. Maria Jose Jimenez Rodriguez, this initial work inspired him to pursue his PhD in the use of Topologial Data Analysis to understand stem cell differentiation, starting in 2024. Also in 2024, he began collaborating with Dr. Blanca de la Cruz Torres and Anselmo Ruiz de Alarcón Quintero on a sports analysis project. Miguel later served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Universidad de Córdoba for ten months, and in January 2025, he joined the Department of Applied Mathematics I at Universidad de Sevilla.
