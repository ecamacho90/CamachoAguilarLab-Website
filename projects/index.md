Understanding **how cells interact** and **interpret dynamic signaling** to create precise spatial patterns during embryonic development is one of the **central questions** in developmental biology, fertility research, and regenerative medicine.

While answering this directly in humans presents technical and ethical challenges, new tools in stem cell research and bioengineering have opened a window into quantitatively answering these questions in vitro. By integrating these methods with mathematical modeling, such as a novel mathematical and statistical framework we developed inspired by the Waddington landscape formalism (Camacho-Aguilar E, Warmflash A, Rand DA, PLoS Computational Biology 2021, Saez M, Blassberg R, Camacho-Aguilar E et al, Cell Systems 2022), our lab aims to gain deeper insights into human development.

We are dedicated to merging **stem cell research** and **mathematics** to enhance our understanding of development. Some topics we are interested in are: dynamic signalling interpretation, cell-cell interactions, patterning, mathematical modelling of cell fate transitions.
