The Sy(stem)s Developmental Biology Lab opens its doors at the [CABD](https://www.cabd.es/en/)! And we discuss the journey in a [new post](https://thenode.biologists.com/a-homeward-bound-scientist-setting-up-a-stem-cell-research-lab-in-seville/careers/) in the [New PI Diaries](https://thenode.biologists.com/new-pi-diaries/) organized by [The Node](https://thenode.biologists.com/).
